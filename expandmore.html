        <h1>Experience</h1>
        <p>
            Melaleuca Call Center: At Melaleuca, we focused on giving Exceptional Customer Care .
            Here, I would make new memberships, help customers with their orders, help with any online support
            that they needed, and would likewise assist with anything that would be considered customer service,
            such as returning items, refunds, and cancellations. I would do this not only in English but would
            also assist our Spanish Speaking customers. <br>Walgreens Pharmacy:At Walgreens, I was a store associate,
            meaning that I would mostly be on the floor, as well as working at the front register, or any other
            register if necessary. Not only that, but I would work in the Photo Department throughout the shift.
            I would assist customers with their needs and would help keep the store stocked, would help keep track
            of inventory and would help maintain cleanliness in all aspects. Some other jobs included translating
            in the pharmacy and assisting Spanish speaking customers, as there weren’t many other Spanish Speaking
            associates. <br>Benchmark Physical Therapy Physical Therapy Clinic: At Benchmark, my official job title
            was Office Coordinator- Float. This entailed making appointments for new and returning patients,
            including Evaluations, Follow-ups, Dry Needling, and Lymphedema appointments. Not only that, but
            I dealt with different insurance companies and made sure the patient was covered for their PT
            and/or OT visits. As a Float, I had a home clinic where I was at for 2 days a week, and the rest
            of the week was spent at different clinics filling in for the Full Time OCs or assisting in really
            busy clinics. <br> Triscapes Inc. Landscaping: During this job, I worked in softball, baseball and soccer
            fields using big machinery to cut grass and work in the maintenance part of the company. I worked on
            a team to keep fields looking good and picked up garbage.

        <h1>Education</h1>

        <p>
            I am currently a Software Engineering student at Brigham Young University- Idaho.
            Prior to my University career, I was an academically rigorous student. In High School,
            I took a total of 11 AP courses, while also having taken various AP exams and
            scoring 3’s and 4’s. Likewise, during my last year of High School, I participated
            in the Quest Gifted Internship, where I spent various hours a week in a hospital learning
            and observing different cases and patient care in the PACU. Here I was able to learn from
            all of the different nurses and learn a lot and care for various patients.
