        <div>
    Melaleuca 
    Call Center- At Melaleuca, we focused on giving Exceptional Customer Care . Here, I would make new memberships, help customers with their orders, help with any online support that they needed, and would likewise assist with anything that would be considered customer service, such as returning items, refunds, and cancellations. I would do this not only in English but would also assist our Spanish Speaking customers. 


    Walgreens
    Pharmacy-At Walgreens, I was a store associate, meaning that I would mostly be on the floor, as well as working at the front register, or any other register if necessary. Not only that, but I would work in the Photo Department throughout the shift. I would assist customers with their needs and would help keep the store stocked, would help keep track of inventory and would help maintain cleanliness in all aspects. Some other jobs included translating in the pharmacy and assisting Spanish speaking customers, as there weren’t many other Spanish 
    Speaking associates.  

    Benchmark Physical Therapy
    Physical Therapy Clinic - At Benchmark, my official job title was Office Coordinator- Float. This entailed making appointments for new and returning patients, including Evaluations, Follow-ups, Dry Needling, and Lymphedema appointments. Not only that, but I dealt with different insurance companies and made sure the patient was covered for their PT and/or OT visits. As a Float, I had a home clinic where I was at for 2 days a week, and the rest of the week was spent at different clinics filling in for the Full Time OCs or assisting in really busy clinics. 


    Triscapes Inc. 
    Landscaping - During this job, I worked in softball, baseball and soccer fields using big machinery to cut grass and work in the maintenance part of the company. I worked on a team to keep fields looking good and picked up garbage.

    <br>Education
     <div>
    I am currently a Software Engineering student at Brigham Young University- Idaho. Prior to my University career, I was an academically rigorous student. In High School, I took a total of 11 AP courses, while also having taken various AP exams and scoring 3’s and 4’s. Likewise, during my last year of High School, I participated in the Quest Gifted Internship, where I spent various hours a week in a hospital learning and observing different cases and patient care in the 
    PACU. Here I was able to learn from all of the different nurses and learn a lot and care for various patients.

        <br>Work/ Life Balance
        <div>
        Balancing work and everything that we do is super hard! Something that I love to do is to spend time completely with myself, away from any school and work. Going to the gym is probably my favorite thing to do to help me relax and enjoy myself. Not only that, but I love spending any free time I have with my boyfriend and with my dog! They’re so great at helping me feel complete.
